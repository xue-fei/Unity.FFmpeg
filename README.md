# Unity.FFmpeg
forked from https://github.com/hangarter/FFmpeg4Unity

## About this project
This project has the goal for getting FFmpeg embedded into unity for as many devices as possible.
All FFmpeg features exposed by FFmpeg.Autogen will be available, with c# classes and components that provide easier use than directly using C functions.

## State of the project
This is a brand new project, there's an example project where we can stream video from an rdp source into a texture.

## License
This project is under GPLv3 (which means that if you use it you should provide the source of any changes on this library even if done commercially).
